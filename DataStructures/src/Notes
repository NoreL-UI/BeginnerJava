What is a data structure?
    way of organizing data to be used effectively

Why?
    creating fast powerful algorithms, manage/organize data, and makes code cleaner and easier to read

Abstract data type vs Data Structures
    ADT: a data type, where only behavior is defined but not implementation.
    ex.) Array, List, Map, Queue, Stack, Set, Table, Tree, and Vector

    ADT     DS
    List    Dynamic Array, Linked List
    Queue   Linked List, Array, and Stack based Queues
    Map     Tree Map, Hash map, Hash table

Computational Complexity Analysis
    how much [Time] and [Space] for algorithm to finish

    Big-O Notation describes performance or complexity of a algorithm
        O(1)        - constant
        O(log(n))   - logarithmic
        O(n)        - linear
        O(n^2)      - quadratic
        O(n log(n)) - linearithmic

Static and Dynamic Arrays
    Static Array: fixed length container, contains n elements. Index range from o to n-1. {1, 2, 3}; i = 0 to 2

    Where are they used:
        1. Storing and accessing data
        2. Temporarily storing objects
        3. Used by IO routines as buffers
        4. Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
        5. Can return multiple values from function
        6. Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to sub problems

    Complexity
                Static  Dynamic
        Access  O(1)    O(1)
        Search  O(n)    O(n)
        Insert  N/A     O(n)
        Append  N/A     O(1)
        Delete  N/A     O(n)

    Static Array
        int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        index i =  0, 1, 2, 3, 4

    Dynamic Array
        Can grow and shrink in size
                    A = {34, 4}
        A.add(-7)       {34, 4, -7}
        A.remove(4)     {34, -7, 34}

        Implementing Dynamic Array
            can use static array
            add elements, keep tracking
            if exceeding capacity, create new static array and copy original elements

        ex.) empty array {_, _}, add 7 and -9 ->                {7, -9}
             We want to add another number 3, double size of    {7, -9, 3, _}
                new array and copy numbers
             We can add 12 to array because there is a empty    {7, -9, 3, 12}
                spot
             We want to add 5 but no room                       {7, -9, 3, 12, 5, _, _, _}
                double new array size and copy elements
