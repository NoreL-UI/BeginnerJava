    /*
    Class: like a blueprint/template to create objects

    Object: instance of a class, has behavior and state

    Method: Behavior of an object

    Public Classes: Can be accessed from anywhere in the program
        Why? Can be accessed by other developers to use if library or API, also be used as an entry point

    Private Classes: Class: Can only be accessed within the same class its declared
        Why? in general make classes as private as possible to improve security and less complex.
             If you have a helper class or supporting class is used within larger/related classes.
             Can help coupling and improve encapsulation

    Void Classes: Indicates the method doesn't return any value. Performs action but no output/result
